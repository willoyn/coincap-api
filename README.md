# coincap-api

### A server that accepts GraphQL queries with the help of apollo-server, retrieves data from [coincap RESTful API](https://docs.coincap.io/#intro) and returns it to the [client.](https://github.com/willoyn/coincap)

Run `npm i` to install dependencies and `npm start` to run the server on `localhost:4000`.

You can also run [https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer) to run a live GraphQL sandbox in a browser.
